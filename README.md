# Assignment
MYLAPS Sports Timing offers the best-in-class sports timing systems to measure, publish and analyze race and practice results for all sports. In this assignment we ask you create a simple piece of software that demonstrates how you build resilient, testable code. It does not have to be a fully functioning, polished solution.
The solution should be build using C++. It may be a command line or GUI application, thatâ€™s up to you.
The application should calculate the result of a race based on lap times collected during a race.

## Requirements
* A race consists of up to five drivers racing around the track for a fixed number of laps (driving from the start/finish line to the start/finish line).
* The kart number and the time of day are measured by the timing system each time a driver passes the start/finish line of the racing track. The software should accept these lap times in the form of the attached karttimes.csv file.
* The race is finished when one of the drivers completes all laps.
* The winner of a race is the driver who has driven the fastest lap.
* The application should return the winner of the race, including the winning lap.

## Notes
* Your assignment will be evaluated on technical design, code quality, testability and commit hygiene.
* Make sure that your project is accessible on a git repository.
* Please do not spend more than 8 hours on this assessment.
* Add a note for the parts you did not have time for, but you think should have been
included.
